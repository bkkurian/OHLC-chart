OLHC code improvement Areas:

1. Dyanamically pass below variable and state management for below feilds

            let defaultGap = 20;
            
            let defaultPriceGap = 10; 
            
            let noOfSlots =8;
            
            let defaultY = 600;
            
            let defaultOpenCloseWidth = 8;
            
2. Need to add more reusable child components.
3. Using browser storage mechanism(local storage, indexDB, session storage), need to save the state of application for continuous usage(refresh). Now its handle in code using session storage, we can optimize it in store level using lib such as "localforage"
